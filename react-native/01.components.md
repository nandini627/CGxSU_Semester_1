# 🧩 React Native Components

Components are the **building blocks of a React Native application**.  
Every screen, button, text, or image you see in a React Native app is made using components.

---

## What is a Component?

A **component** is a reusable piece of UI that controls how a part of the app looks and behaves.

In React Native:
- Everything is a component
- Components can be reused
- Components can accept data using **props**
- Components can manage data using **state**

---

## Types of Components in React Native

There are mainly **two types of components**:

### 1️⃣ Functional Components (Recommended)

Functional components are **simple JavaScript functions** that return UI.

```js
import { View, Text } from "react-native";

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Hello React Native</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
export default MyComponent;
```

✅ Most commonly used  
✅ Works with Hooks  
✅ Cleaner and easier to understand  

---

## 2️⃣ Class Components (Older Approach)

Class components use **ES6 classes** and **lifecycle methods**.

```js
import React, { Component } from "react";
import { View, Text } from "react-native";

class MyComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>Hello React Native</Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
}

export default MyComponent;
```
⚠️ Mostly seen in older codebases  
⚠️ Not recommended for beginners  

---

## 🧩 Core Built-in Components

React Native provides many **pre-built components** to build UI.

---

### 📦 View
- Works like a `div` in web
- Used for layout and grouping

```jsx
import { View, Text } from "react-native";

<View>
  <Text>Inside View</Text>
</View>
```
---

### 📝 Text
- Used to display text
- All text must be inside a `Text` component

```jsx
import { Text } from "react-native";

<Text>Hello World</Text>
```
> ⚠️ In React Native, you **cannot** place plain text directly inside `View`.  

---

### 📷 Image
- Used to display images

```jsx
import { Image } from "react-native";

<Image
  source={{ uri: "https://example.com/image.png" }}
  style={{ width: 100, height: 100 }}
/>
```
> ℹ️ **In React Native, images must have `width` and `height`**, otherwise they will not appear.
---

### 📜 ScrollView
- Enables scrolling when content overflows

```jsx
import { ScrollView, Text } from "react-native";

<ScrollView>
<Text>Scrollable content</Text>
</ScrollView>
```
> ⚠️ **ScrollView renders all items at once**, so it is not ideal for large data lists.
---

### 📋 FlatList
- Used to render large lists efficiently
- Preferred over ScrollView for long lists

```jsx
import { FlatList, Text, View } from "react-native";

const DATA = [
  { id: "1", name: "Rajesh" },
  { id: "2", name: "Amit" },
  { id: "3", name: "Neha" },
];

<FlatList
  data={DATA}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
  renderItem={({ item }) => (
    <View>
      <Text>{item.name}</Text>
    </View>
  )}
/>
```
> 🚀 **FlatList improves performance** by rendering only visible items on the screen.

---

### 📑 SectionList
- Used when data is grouped into sections

```jsx
import { SectionList, Text } from "react-native";

<SectionList
  sections={[
    { title: "A", data: ["Aman", "Ankit"] },
    { title: "B", data: ["Bharat"] },
  ]}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item}</Text>}
  renderSectionHeader={({ section }) => (
    <Text>{section.title}</Text>
  )}
/>
```
> ℹ️ **Example:** Contacts grouped by alphabet.

---

### ⌨️ TextInput
- Used to take user input
- Commonly used in forms, login, search

```jsx
import { TextInput } from "react-native";

<TextInput
  placeholder="Enter your name"
  style={{ borderWidth: 1, padding: 10 }}
/>
```
> ℹ️ **TextInput supports many props** like `value`, `onChangeText`, `keyboardType`, and `secureTextEntry`.
---
### Pressable
- Used for touch interactions (buttons)

```jsx
import { Text, Pressable } from "react-native";

<Pressable onPress={() => alert("Pressed!")}>
 <Text>Click Me</Text>
</Pressable>
```
> ℹ️ `Pressable` is preferred over `Button` for custom styling.

---

## 📦 Props (Passing Data to Components)

Props allow you to pass data from one component to another.

```jsx
import { Text } from "react-native";

function Greeting(props) {
  return <Text>Hello {props.name}</Text>;
}

<Greeting name="Rajesh" />
```
👉 **Props are read-only.**

---

## 🔁 State (Managing Data Inside a Component)

State is used to store and update data inside a component.

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";
import { View, Text, Pressable } from "react-native";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Count: {count}</Text>
      <Pressable onPress={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        <Text>Increase</Text>
      </Pressable>
    </View>
  );
}
```
👉 When state changes, the UI automatically updates.

---

## 🧠 Stateless vs Stateful Components

- **Stateless Component**
  - Uses only props
  - Does not manage its own data

- **Stateful Component**
  - Uses state
  - Manages dynamic data and UI updates

---

## ♻️ Component Reusability

One of the biggest advantages of components is **reusability**.

```jsx
function Button({ title }) {
  return (
    <Pressable>
      <Text>{title}</Text>
    </Pressable>
  );
}

<Button title="Login" />
<Button title="Register" />
```

## ⚔️ Difference Between React JS & React Native Components

| React JS | React Native |
|--------|--------------|
| div | View |
| span, p | Text |
| button | Pressable |
| img | Image |

## ❓ When Should You Create a New Component?

Create a new component when:
- UI is reused multiple times
- Code becomes too long
- Logic can be separated
- UI represents a single responsibility

---

## ✅ Best Practices for Components

- Keep components **small and focused**
- Reuse components whenever possible
- Separate UI and logic when possible
- Use meaningful component names
- Prefer functional components

---

## 📝 Summary

- Components are the foundation of React Native apps
- Everything you see is a component
- Functional components are recommended
- Props pass data, state manages data
- Reusable components make apps scalable
